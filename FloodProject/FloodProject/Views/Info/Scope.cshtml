            The application is intended to be used as a reference by those who wish to evaluate their preparedness under a variety of flood conditions.
            The data provided may then be used to better understand the risks associated with a particular location as well as inform potential steps that may be taken to reduce risk.
            Providing a clearer understanding of flooding scenarios, their risks, and mitigations has both public safety, as well as insurance implications.
            The application will also provide useful information about flooding in the Tampa Bay area (and beyond) to individuals who wish to understand, in greater detail, the pattern of flooding and how it affects the region as a whole.
            This could be advantageous not only to consumers of flood insurance, but also to underwriters, appraisers, and other professionals who maintain structures at flood sites and assess the risk of floods to geographic locations.
