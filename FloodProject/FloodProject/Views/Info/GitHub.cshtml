                        <p>Github is a Web-based graphical interface for a cental-repository version control system.</p> 
                        <p>This allows copies of a main project to be pulled down and worked on locally to an individual's system, with any revisions made locally being merged to a central location and any undesired changes may be easily rolled back to a prior state.</p>
                        <p>Github is able to be integrated with many Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), in particular Visual Studio for this project. More can be read about GitHub here:</p>
