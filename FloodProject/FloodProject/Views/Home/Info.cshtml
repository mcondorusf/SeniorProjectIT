            This project was created as an assignment for the University of South Florida Senior IT Project (CIS4935) during the Summer 2019 term. 
            This is a web application which provides users with specific flood data based on input of a location with the intention of informing the user of the Base Flood Elevation (BFE) and providing a recommendation for the minimum build elevation of a structure's first floor at this location. 
            The application makes use of flood data API and a Geographical Information System (GIS) to find and present flood data and layers within a navigational map interface.
            This is an open source application. While there are applications that offer similar functionality, this software intends to extend and marry the functionality of multiple sources, and offer feedback not present in other tools.

            The application is intended to be used as a reference by those who wish to evaluate their preparedness under a variety of flood conditions. 
            The data provided may then be used to better understand the risks associated with a particular location as well as inform potential steps that may be taken to reduce risk. 
            Providing a clearer understanding of flooding scenarios, their risks, and mitigations has both public safety, as well as insurance implications.
            The application will also provide useful information about flooding in the Tampa Bay area (and beyond) to individuals who wish to understand, in greater detail, the pattern of flooding and how it affects the region as a whole. 
            This could be advantageous not only to consumers of flood insurance, but also to underwriters, appraisers, and other professionals who maintain structures at flood sites and assess the risk of floods to geographic locations.
