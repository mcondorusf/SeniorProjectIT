USF Senior Project IT

This is the IT Senior Project for the group Flood Fighters. 

What this project sets out to do is create a Geographical Information System for the Tampa Bay area. 

We will use API data to find flood information for a geographical area. 

Then we will translate that data into an interface that will represent the flood data on a map for the user to view.
